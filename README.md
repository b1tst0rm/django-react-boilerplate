# django-react-boilerplate
A boilerplate to integrate the following technologies:
Django (backend)
React JS (frontend)
Redux (state management for React)

The goal for this boilerplate is to provide a simple template that encourages
rapid, pain-free development of a modern, single-page web application.

Feel free to open issues with problems, bugs, or questions. I will do my best
to address them.

## Setup
Using a virtualenv with Python 3, install pip dependencies: `pip install -r project/requirements.txt`

Install NPM and Node.

Install NPM dependencies by navigating to `./project/frontend/` and running `npm install`

## Usage
Run the hot webpack development server for live reloading: `npm run start`

Run the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`
