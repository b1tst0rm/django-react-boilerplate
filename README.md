# django-react-boilerplate
A boilerplate to integrate the following technologies:
Django (backend)
React JS (frontend)
Redux (state management for React)

The goal for this boilerplate is to provide a simple template that encourages
rapid, pain-free development of a modern, single-page web application.

Feel free to open issues with problems, bugs, or questions. I will do my best
to address them.
